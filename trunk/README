HDFS-FUSE
============

HDFS-FUSE lets you to mount a HDFS in userspace.

===========
How to use
===========

on Linux 2.6:

  FUSE:
    # yum install fuse fuse-libs fuse-devel (Redhat/SuSE)
    # sudo apt-get install fuse fuse-libs fuse-devel (Debian/Ubuntu)

  Hadoop:
    $ tar xvzf hadoop-0.17.0.tar.gz
    $ cd xvzf hadoop-0.17.0/bin
    (for Pseudo-Distributed mode)
    $ ./hadoop namenode -format
    $ ./start-all.sh
    (Java Runtime Environment is needed to run Hadoop, see Hadoop's reference)

  HDFS-FUSE:
    $ tar xvzf hdfs-fuse.linux2.6-gcc4.1-x86.tar.gz
    $ cd hdfs-fuse.linux2.6-gcc4.1-x86/conf	(modify hdfs-fuse.conf for your Hadoop cluster)
    $ cd ../bin

    (To mount)
    $ export JAVA_HOME=<your-java-installation-directory>
    $ export HADOOP_HOME=<your-hadoop-installation-directory>
    $ export FUSE_HOME=<your-fuse-installation-directory>
    $ export HDFS-FUSE_HOME=<the-current-directory>
    $ export HDFS-FUSE_CONF=<the-current-directory>/conf    
    $ ./hdfs-mount <your-mount-point>

    (To umount)
    $ fusermount -u <your-mount-point>


============
Notes
============

The current implementation of HDFS-FUSE only supported a limited set of filesystem feature.

    Supported operation:
		Open/close files
        Rename(mv)/delete files
        list directories
        get file attributes
		get filesystem attributes

    In-development: (Coding complete, in testing phrase)
		Create/write files   
		Flush

    Future roadmap plan:
        create/delete directories
		chmod/chown
		etc, ...
